                <p>History has taught us that having a “no giving up” attitude can make one accomplish great things.
                    This is evident in the lives of famous people who were successful in achieving their goals, even

                    <h4>Benefits of “Never Give Up”</h4>
                    <p>The American “Queen of all Media” went through a lot while growing up. She faced sexual abuse,
                        molestation, racism, and early teenage pregnancy. The baby died shortly after Winfrey gave
                        birth. These experiences didn’t stop her from becoming an honors student at the end of high
                        school—enabling her to win a college scholarship.

                <p>Ma’s story of difficulty continued after he started Alibaba. The company didn’t become profitable
                    until after a period of three years. All the Silicon Valley investors who he requested funding from
                    declined. It got to a time when the company was nearing bankruptcy. This didn’t discourage Jack. His
                    tenacity later yielded the great results that we know of today.</p>

                    entrance exam twice. The same thing happened when he wanted to gain admission into college—another
                    double failure in the entrance exams! Ma also had a series of ten rejection letters from Harvard
                    University. Talk about a very determined person. See why his words are among our list of “keep t</p>

            <p>Nelson Mandela was the most significant figure in the fight against the oppressive Apartheid regime. In
                1993, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace due to his democratic take-over from the Apartheid
                government.
                Mandela was imprisoned for 27 years (1962 to 1990) for conspiring against the Apartheid government. It
                was a life sentence, but he was released due to local and international pressure. Nelson had become 72
                years old by then. Wasted life? No! He continued the struggle until the fight was won when he became
                president in 1994.</p>
